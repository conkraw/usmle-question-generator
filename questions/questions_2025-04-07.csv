30051F48,"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician's office by his mother who reports that he has been having difficulty with balance and coordination for the past few months. She also mentions that he has been having trouble with his vision and has been stumbling over objects. On examination, the boy has a wide-based gait, decreased muscle tone, and nystagmus. His deep tendon reflexes are absent and he has a positive Romberg sign. His recent school report indicates a decline in academic performance.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Multiple sclerosis,Friedreich's ataxia,Guillain-Barre syndrome,Cerebral palsy,Muscular dystrophy,b,"This child's presentation of gait ataxia, dysarthria, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and positive Romberg sign is suggestive of Friedreich's ataxia, a neurodegenerative disorder that often presents in childhood with progressive gait disturbance. It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia, spinocerebellar tracts, and corticospinal tracts. Vision changes can occur due to optic atrophy. The other options listed do not typically present with this constellation of symptoms.",7.0,14
E9F57968,"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician's office by his parents. They report that he has been experiencing episodes of rapid heart rate, palpitations, and shortness of breath for the past few months. These episodes occur suddenly, last for a few minutes, and then resolve spontaneously. The boy is otherwise healthy with no significant past medical history. His physical examination is unremarkable, and an EKG is performed.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Atrial fibrillation,Supraventricular tachycardia,Ventricular tachycardia,Sinus tachycardia,Atrial flutter,b,"This child's sudden episodes of rapid heart rate, palpitations, and shortness of breath that resolve spontaneously are characteristic of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). SVT is the most common pediatric tachyarrhythmia. Other options like atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, and atrial flutter are less likely in a healthy child with no significant past medical history.",7.0,2
43768F34,"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician's office by his mother, who reports that her son has been having difficulty walking for the past two weeks. She also notes that he has been falling frequently and seems to have trouble getting up from a seated position. On examination, the boy's gait is waddling and he uses his hands to 'walk' up his body from a squatting position. His cognitive development and social interactions are appropriate for his age. His mother mentions that his older brother had similar symptoms at his age.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Cerebral palsy,Muscular dystrophy,Spina bifida,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Guillain-Barr√© syndrome,b,"This child's difficulty walking, frequent falls, waddling gait, and Gowers' sign (using hands to 'walk' up the body from a squatting position) are classic signs of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder, which explains why the patient's older brother had similar symptoms. The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and family history.",3.0,4
31843963,"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician's office by his parents. They report that over the past few weeks, he has been experiencing fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and frequent nosebleeds. His parents also noticed that he has developed multiple bruises on his arms and legs. On physical examination, the boy appears pale and has multiple petechiae on his lower extremities. A complete blood count reveals a decreased number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Hemophilia A,Iron deficiency anemia,Von Willebrand disease,a,"The boy's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, nosebleeds, bruising, and petechiae, along with pancytopenia on complete blood count, are suggestive of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL is the most common malignancy in children and often presents with these nonspecific symptoms due to bone marrow infiltration. The other options are less likely because they typically present with isolated thrombocytopenia (ITP, hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease) or anemia (iron deficiency anemia), not pancytopenia.",6.0,17
2100BC7F,"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician's office by his mother who reports that her son has been scratching his skin intensely for the past week. She noticed a rash on his arms and legs that seems to be spreading. The rash is characterized by red, scaly patches and small, raised bumps. The boy has a history of asthma and allergies. On physical examination, the pediatrician notes dry, thickened skin on the flexural surfaces of the boy's arms and legs.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Contact dermatitis,Psoriasis,Atopic dermatitis,Seborrheic dermatitis,Impetigo,c,"This patient's intense pruritus, history of asthma and allergies, and physical examination findings of eczematous dermatitis on flexural surfaces are characteristic of atopic dermatitis (eczema). Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that often begins in infancy or early childhood. It is associated with other atopic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. The other answer choices are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings.",6.0,3

34B5B3D0,"A 3-year-old boy is admitted to the pediatric ward with a 2-day history of vomiting and lethargy. His mother reports that he has been drinking more water than usual over the past week, and has had a poor appetite. On examination, he is drowsy but responsive. His skin is dry and he has deep-set eyes. His heart rate is 120 beats per minute and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. Laboratory tests reveal a blood glucose level of 600 mg/dL and urine tests show glucose and ketones.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Diabetic Ketoacidosis,Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State,Hypoglycemia,c,"The child's symptoms of polydipsia, lethargy, and vomiting, along with the laboratory findings of hyperglycemia and ketonuria, are indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. DKA typically presents with a combination of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is less common in this age group and does not typically present with DKA. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State is a complication of Type 2 Diabetes and is characterized by extreme hyperglycemia without significant ketosis or acidosis. Hypoglycemia would present with low blood glucose levels.",3.0,13
B272EDD5,"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician's office by his mother, who reports that her son has been experiencing persistent fatigue and unexplained weight loss over the past two months. She also mentions that he has been having frequent nosebleeds and bruising easily. On physical examination, the boy appears pale and has multiple ecchymoses on his arms and legs. A complete blood count reveals a decreased hemoglobin level, a low platelet count, and an elevated white blood cell count with blasts noted on peripheral smear.",What is the underlying pathophysiology?,Decreased production of clotting factors,Overactive immune response leading to destruction of blood cells,Uncontrolled proliferation of immature blood cells,Deficiency in iron absorption leading to anemia,Excessive destruction of red blood cells,c,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, pallor, easy bruising, and nosebleeds, along with the laboratory findings of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with blasts, are suggestive of leukemia. The underlying pathophysiology of leukemia is the uncontrolled proliferation of immature blood cells in the bone marrow, which suppresses the production of normal blood cells. The other options do not accurately describe the pathophysiology of leukemia.",6.0,17
F9C5F5D1,"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother who is concerned about his walking pattern. She reports that he has been walking on his toes for the past 6 months. She denies any history of trauma, pain, or previous similar episodes. On physical examination, the child walks on his toes bilaterally with no apparent discomfort. His gait is otherwise normal and he has a full range of motion in all joints. Neurological examination is unremarkable. What is the next best step in management?",What is the next best step in management?,Refer for orthopedic surgery consultation,Order a complete blood count,Initiate physical therapy,Order an MRI of the brain,Reassure and observe,e,"This child's presentation is consistent with idiopathic toe walking, which is a common and benign condition in children. It usually resolves spontaneously by age 10. As the child is asymptomatic and the neurological examination is normal, the best next step is reassurance and observation. The other options are not indicated in the absence of other concerning symptoms or findings.",7.0,19
28921BF1,"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents due to a sudden onset of difficulty breathing. His parents report that he was playing in the park when he suddenly started coughing, wheezing, and complaining of chest tightness. He has a known history of asthma and allergies, and his symptoms have worsened despite using his prescribed albuterol inhaler. On examination, he appears to be in respiratory distress with decreased breath sounds bilaterally, intercostal retractions, and prolonged expiratory phase. His oxygen saturation is 90% on room air.",What is the appropriate treatment?,Oral corticosteroids,Intravenous antibiotics,Inhaled corticosteroids,Supplemental oxygen and nebulized albuterol,Chest physiotherapy,d,"This child is presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation, characterized by coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and respiratory distress. The first-line treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation is supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxemia and nebulized short-acting beta-agonists (e.g., albuterol) for bronchodilation. Oral corticosteroids may be used for severe exacerbations or if symptoms do not improve after initial treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids are used for long-term control of asthma, not for acute exacerbations. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is a suspicion of bacterial infection, and chest physiotherapy is not typically used in the management of asthma.",7.0,11
5A44A30B,"A 3-year-old boy is admitted to the pediatric ICU following a near-drowning incident in a swimming pool. He was submerged for approximately 5 minutes before being rescued. On arrival, he was unconscious, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated. His initial arterial blood gas showed severe hypoxia and hypercapnia. A CT scan of the brain showed diffuse cerebral edema. He has been receiving supportive care for the past 48 hours, but there has been no significant improvement in his neurological status.",What is the expected prognosis?,Full recovery with no neurological deficits,Partial recovery with minor neurological deficits,Partial recovery with major neurological deficits,"No recovery, persistent vegetative state",Death,d,"Given the duration of submersion, the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and the presence of diffuse cerebral edema on CT scan, this child is likely to have suffered severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The prognosis in such cases is generally poor, with many patients remaining in a persistent vegetative state.",3.0,3

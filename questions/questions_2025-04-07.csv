The pain has been present for about 2 weeks and is worse with activity, particularly running. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the knee. On physical examination, the knee is not swollen or erythematous, but there is tenderness to palpation over the tibial tubercle. He has a normal range of motion in the knee. Radiographs of the knee are normal.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Osgood-Schlatter disease,Patellar tendonitis,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Septic arthritis,Ligament tear,a,"The patient's presentation is consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, a common cause of knee pain in adolescents. It is caused by repetitive stress on the tibial tubercle, leading to inflammation and pain. The condition is often seen in adolescents who participate in sports that involve running and jumping. The other options are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings.",14.0,19

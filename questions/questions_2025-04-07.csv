The pain is described as crampy and is usually located around the umbilicus. It does not radiate and is not associated with any other symptoms. The episodes last for a few hours and then resolve spontaneously. The child is otherwise healthy and his growth and development are appropriate for his age. His physical examination is unremarkable. His mother is worried and wants to know what could be causing the pain.,What is the next best step in management?,Order an abdominal ultrasound,Start a trial of proton pump inhibitors,Reassure the mother and observe the child,Order a complete blood count,Refer the child to a gastroenterologist,c,"This child's presentation is consistent with functional abdominal pain, which is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is the most common cause of recurrent abdominal pain in children. The pain is usually periumbilical, comes and goes, and does not interfere with the child's growth and development. The next best step in management is to reassure the mother and observe the child.

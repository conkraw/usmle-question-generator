Which of the following recommendations is most appropriate for this patient? Change to another oral contraceptive with a higher estrogenic and lower androgeniceffect. Change to a progestin/estrogen vaginal ring. Make no change in the type of oral contraceptive, but begin oral antibiotic and topical therapy for acne. Change to another oral contraceptive with a lower estrogenic and higher androgenic effect. Change to a transdermal contraceptive patch. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Change to another oral contraceptive with a higher estrogenic and lower androgeni Explanation & Oral contraceptives that have a low androgenic effect are less likely to cause acne. The balance between estrogens and progestins determines both the overall effect on the endometrium and the side effect profile of an oral contraceptive. In general, a teenager with acne will benefit from an oral contraceptive with high estrogenic and low androgenic activity. The inhibitory effect of estrogen on acne appears to be due to estrogen-mediated suppression of sebum production. Estrogen also acts to suppress ovarian androgen production. Most progestins in oral contraceptives have androgenic properties. Newer progestins are generally less androgenic and have fewer side effects; some even have antiandrogenic properties. However, some of the later generation"

Which of the following most accurately describes expected pubertal growth parameters in boys? Peak weight velocity follows peak height velocity by 9-12 months. Adult height can be predicted by adding 5 cm to the mother's height. During puberty, the percentage of lean body mass decreases proportionately to an increase in the percentage of body fat. Atthe completion of puberty, testicular volume averages 20 mL. Peak height velocity occurs during sexual maturity rating 2. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer At the completion of puberty, testicular volume averages 20 mL. Explanation h The first visible sign of puberty in males is an increase in testicular volume. Prior to the onset of puberty, testicular volume is < 4 mL. Testicular volume increases throughout puberty, averaging 4-8 mL in volume in sexual maturity rating (SMR) 2; 8-12 mLin SMR 3; 12-20 mL in SMR 4; and ~ 20 mL in SMR 5. Peak height velocity coincides with peak weight velocity in males, while peak weight velocity follows peak height velocity by 6-9 months in females.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Fluoxetine Cefixime Hydrochlorothiazide Carbamazepine * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Carbamazepine Explanation h Several drugs are known to decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives, including antiseizure medications such as carbamazepine, primidone, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, felbamate and phenytoin. Antiseizure medications that do not reduce oral contraceptive efficacy include gabapentin, levetiracetam, and valproate. (One mechanism of action through which some of these antiseizure medications (a.k.a. anticonvulsants) reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills is by increasing the activity of the hepatic cytochrome p450 system in the liver. This results in altered metabolism of the hormones contained in oral contraceptive pills, leading to insufficient levels of estrogen and progesterone to raliahlv nrevent nraenaney"

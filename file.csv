Kidney stones Hyperkalemia Nephrocalcinosis Fanconi syndrome Urine pH > 5.5 * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Fanconi syndrome Explanation All types of RTA are associated with a hyperchloremic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Fanconi syndrome is the only feature in the listed options that occurs with proximal (Type 2) RTA. Fanconi syndrome is a generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule causing bicarbonate, phosphate, glucose, and amino acid losses. Causes of Fanconi syndrome include genetic conditions (such as cystinosis or galactosemia) or acquired causes (such as injury from toxins, medications, or immunologic factors). Kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, and urine pH > 5.5 are associated with distal (Type 1) RTA, not proximal RTA. Hyperkalemia is seen in Type 4 RTA (characterized by aldosterone deficiency or resistance). Type 4 RTA can be caused by diabetes mellitus, medications (NSAIDs, calcineurin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, trimethoprim, and pentamidine), adrenal insufficiency, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

How do you advise her regarding breastfeeding of her newborn baby? Tell her that most newborns breastfeed about every 2-3 hours, or ~ 8-12 times every 24 hours. Tell her to adhere to rigid schedules for feeding interval and duration, per AAP recommendations. Tell her to feed the newborn from one breast only per day, offering the same side breast with every feed. Tell her to use the same breastfeeding position every time because it reduces the occurrence of mastitis in the mother. Tell her to use refrigerated breast milk within 14 days. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Tell her that most newborns breastfeed about every 2-3 hours, or ~ 8-12 times every 24 hours. Explanation Most breastfed newborns feed about every 2-3 hours, or ~ 8-12 times every 24 hours. By 2 months of age, most infants feed every 3-4 hours, and typically stop one of the middle-of-the-night feedings. By 4 months of age, most infants feed every 4-5 hours. The frequency and length of feeds via breastfeeding vary as the baby gets older and begins consuming more and more complementary (solid) foods. Because breast mi digested more rapidly than formula (due to its protein composition), infants who are breastfed generally feed more often than infants who are bottle fed.

Fibrous dysplasia of the long bones Dysostosis multiplex in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae Pelvicand calcaneal apophysitis Defects of the pars interarticularis in the lumbar vertebrae Sacral agenesis * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Dysostosis multiplex in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae Explanation MPS Type 1 is the most severe subtype of mucopolysaccharidosis Type 1. The mucopolysaccharidoses are lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficiencies of enzymes responsible for the breakdown of mucopolysaccharides (also known as_ glycosaminoglycans). Partial breakdown products accumulate in the lysosomes, leading to cellular dysfunction and multisystem disorders. Although infants with MPS Type 1 appear normal at birth, coarse facial features become apparent during the 1° year of life. A wide nasal bridge is typically associated with a flattened midface. Recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections associated with profuse thickened secretions are common. Many patients have both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss."

First, we must identify that the patient is in hemolytic crisis (pallor, dark urine, and jaundice). Then, based on his ethnicity and the link between the crisis and primaquine, we need to make the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency. Another classic trigger for hemolytic crisis in patients with G6PD deficiency is the consumption of fava beans. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia usually is preceded by some sort of viral prodrome, such as an upper respiratory infection. Given that the clinical vignette does not describe this history, autoimmune hemolytic anemia is not as likely as G6PD deficiency. SG"

Vital signs are stable. On physical exam, he is well appearing, has mild jaundice, and his testes are descended bilaterally. The urethral meatus is located on the ventral aspect of the penis shaft. What is the recommendation for this patient? Circumcision should be performed in his outpatient pediatrician's office. Circumcision should be avoided until jaundice resolves. Circumcision should be completed by a urologist at the time of hypospadias repair. Circumcision should be completed prior to discharge from the newborn nursery. Circumcision should be completed using only a plastic bell method. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Circumcision should be completed by a urologist at the time of hypospadias repair. Explanation The newborn has hypospadias (ventrally located urethral meatus). Repair of hypospadias requires the use of the intact foreski therefore, circumcision is completed by a urologist along with the hypospadias repair at a later date in infancy. Circumcision should not be completed prior to discharge or at the pediatrician's office because these options would preclude the urologist from using the foreskin to repair the hypospadias defect.

For which of the followingis he likely to have a low functional or absolute level? ca Cinhibitor IgE Surface IgA. Cyclooxygenase * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer C1inhibitor Explanation hs Patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) have recurrent episodes of angioedema, especially of the skin, Gl tract, and upper airway. HAE is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a low or non-functional C1 inhibitor enzyme. The classical pathway of complement activation is initiated by an antibody-antigen interaction. The 15t complement component is C1, a complex composed of 3 proteins. C1 binds to immune complexes with activation mediated by C1q. Active C1 then initiates the cleavage and concomitant activation of C4 and C2. A plasma protease inhibitor, known as C1 esterase inhibitor enzyme, destroys the activated C1. In the past, danazol was very helpful in treating this disorder, as it increases the level of C1 esterase inhibitor. However, danazol may cause several adverse effects as it affects gonadotropins. Consequently, danazol is rarely used now. Current therapies"

You notice several members of her family with a similar appearance. Her labs return with calcium of 6.8 mg/dL. (low), phosphorus of 7.0 mg/dL (high), and parathyroid hormone of 100 pg/mL (high). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Hypoparathyroidism Pseudohypoparathyroidism Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism Vitamin D-deficient rickets Hypophosphatemic rickets * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Pseudohypoparathyroidism Explanation This patient has a form of pseudohypoparathyroidism known as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). AHO is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with a loss of function mutation in GNAS1, a G protein that is part of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor. This mutation prevents cAMP activation and signal transduction when PTH binds to its receptor. This PTH resistance leads to elevated PTH levels, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is distinguished from hypoparathyroidism by the PTH level (elevated with PTH receptor mutation).

In conversation with the family, the father notes that the left testicle is usually in the scrotum. He has never noted the right testicle to bein the scrotum, despite ""warm baths"" Which of the following is the most accurate statement? Cryptorchidism is associated with an elevated lifetime risk of testicular cancer. Surgical biopsy of the testicles is necessary at this time. His risk of infertility is equal to that of the general population. Continued observation can be employed until the onset of puberty. Cryptorchidism is equally common in both preterm and term newborn boys. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view.

The child's age The location of the bruise The shape of the bruise The size of the bruise The color of the bruise * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer The child's age Explanation The age of the child makes it extremely unlikely to incur an accidental bruise in the absence of significant trauma. There is an adage: ""those who cannot cruise rarely bruise."" Children who are not cruising or walking raely have sufficient trauma to cause bruising, unless they undergo a specific trauma such as a motor vehicle collision. Because the child in this case is too young to cruise or walk, the precise location of the bruise (forehead) should not, in itself, increase the clinician's concern for inflicted injury; a bruise in any location on a preambulatory child warrants attention. For toddlers who are ambulatory, on the other hand, the forehead and shins are common places for accidental bruising. Areas that are uncommon at any age and should raise suspicion include ears, neck, trunk, genital area, and posterior body surfaces."

Myopia refers to farsightedness. The prevalence of myopia decreases throughout childhood. Visual acuity reaches the adult level of 20/20 by 5-7 years of age. The majority of children with significant refractory errors complain of blurry vision and eye pain. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Visual acuity reaches the adult level of 20/20 by 5-7 years of age. Explanation Visual acuity typically reaches the adult level of 20/20 by 5-7 years of age. The ""rule of 8s"" is helpful for determining the need for referral in childhood vision screening. The patient's age plus the tens digit of the denominator of their visual acuity should bes 8 (eg. for a 3-year-old: 3+5 = 8 [critical line for normal acuity = 20/50}; for a 5-year-o itical line for normal acuity = 20/30). When children have vision problems they will often not complain. Rather, their behavior typically suggests the probler example, sitting closer to the TV may indicate nearsightedness in a child.

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of hypochromic microcytic anemia. Lack of iron leads to failure of hemoglobin production. The incidence of iron deficiency peaks at 10-18 months of age and then again in adolescent females. It is unusual prior to 5-6 months of age because the normal term infant has adequate iron stores to meet the demands of increasing RBC mass.

mxrest_aXlMI2wpAa,"Question Details An adolescent previously diagnosed with ulcerative colitis develops fatigue, pruritus, hepatosplenomegaly, and an elevated y- glutamyl transferase level. Which of the following would be the best diagnostic test? Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography Colonoscopy Liver biopsy Abdominal CT scan Renal sonogram * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography Explanation ly Ulcerative coli is mostly associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is progressive chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the intra- and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. There is obliteration of peripheral bile ducts and the development of bile duct strictures. Patients will have elevated alkaline phosphatase, y-glutamyl transferase, and liver enzymes. The best diagnostic test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), because this study will show beading (strictures and dilatation) of bile ducts. Although the results can be, in some cases, less precise than endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), MRCP is less invasive and is normally performed first.

The treatment of choice is stem cell transplantation. Facial abnormalities do not occur. Tells are absent and B cells are present. B cells are absent and T cells are present. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer T cells are absent and B cells are present. Explanation 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (a.k.a. DiGeorge syndrome) is a T-cell deficiency due to an early intrauterine malformation of the embryo that can affect several tissues (including the thymus, parathyroids, heart and great vessels, and face). Most cases are not ""complete,"" and therefore there is still adequate immune function, and most patients do not have issues with severe infections. In ""complete"" DiGeorge phenotype, T cells are absent as in severe combined immunodeficiency, and these patients have the same risks from blood and vaccines. B cells are present but cannot function adequately and cannot produce antibodies due to lack of T cell help. Most individuals with ""complete"" DiGeorge phenotype also have profound hypoparathyroidism. Therapies for those with the severe ""complete"" form include intravenous immunoglobulin, isolation, antibiotics as needed, Ca2* management, and cardiac management.

These findings are most likely the result of which of the following? Lead poisoning Fluorosis Chronic mercury intoxication Congenital syphilis Chronic arsenic intoxication * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Fluorosis Explanation Fluorosis, or the result of exposure to too much fluoride, leads to dental anomalies characterized by whitish lines running across the teeth, chalky-brownish enamel discoloration, and/or dental pitting. Water fluoridation has led to a significant reduction in dental caries. Fluoride acts to reduce the solubility of dental enamel, reduce the production of acid by oral flora, and promote remineralization. Fluoride supplementation schedules are based upon age and the fluoride concentration in local water supplies. For children 6 months to 3 years of age living in areas where fluoride concentrations are < 0.3 ppm, a daily supplement of 0.25 mg of fluoride is recommended.

He does not have associated abdominal pain or rectal pain and he has not lost weight. On physical exam, you note prominent brown-black macules on his lips and buccal membrane. Which of the following is most important to perform next? Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy Genetictesting Small bowel follow through Dual contrast CT scan Biopsy of macule on lip * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy N Explanation Painless rectal bleeding is a common presentation for colonic polyps, and the addition of freckling of the lips is suggestive of Peutz- Jeghers syndrome. Children with Peutz-Jeghers have an autosomal dominant mutation that causes them to form hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly colonic polyps, but also in the small bowel. The risk of adenocarcinoma of the colon or small bowel is increased, as are the risks of other forms of cancer, especially gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, the most important next step is to perform both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy to assess for the presence of hamartomatous polyps. 0 cana tact ie available hit it canvas ta ani canfirm the disenncie and daae ant chnw/ the avtant nf nathalngic dicaace in hic ant"
mxrest_by2MHt9Jtu,"Question Details During a health maintenance visit, a patient is able to hold a Cheerio between the fingertip (or fingernail) of the index finger and the thumb, with the distal thumb joint flexed and the proximal thumb joint only slightly flexed. By what age do the majority of infants accomplish this developmental milestone? 12 months of age 2months of age 4 months of age 9 months of age 15 months of age * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer 12 months of age Explanation By 12 months, most infants are able to hold an object between the fingertip of the index finger and the thumb, with the distal thumb joint flexed and the proximal thumb joint only slightly flexed; ie, a pincer grasp. The pincer grasp is used to aid with self- feeding and exploration of smaller objects. With this ability comes the increased risk of aspiration of smaller objects placed in the mouth. Note: We use the AAP and CDC evidence-informed milestones for developmental surveillance; other sources may differ. By 2 months of age, an infant still has an involuntary grasp. Shortly, the palmar grasp reflex will disappear; the infant will bring their hands to midline and will bat at objects."

Laboratory findings include a salicylate level of 64 mg/dL. You start a medication to increase excretion of salicylate by alkalinizing the urine. Which of the following complications is known to interfere with these efforts? Hyponatremia Hypokalemia Hypocaleemia Hypophosphatemia Hypochloremia * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Hypokalemia d Explanation Salicylate toxicity activates the respiratory center of the medulla; hyperpnea and tachypnea lead to respiratory alkalosis associated with increased renal elimination of HCO3"" and increased insensible fluid loss. It also causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a metabolic acidosis. The goal of urine alkalinization is to maintain the urine pH above 8.50 while keeping the serum pH no greater than 7.5 (or 7.55). Salicylate anions also remain within the renal tubule via alkalinization, preventing back-diffusion from the kidneys into the systemic circulation. To some degree, alkalinization prevents salicylate anions in the blood from diffusing across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system as well. Following an initial |V bolus of 1-"

Alarge ventricular septal defect Transposition of the great vessels Anomalous pulmonary venous return, without obstruction Truncus arteriosus Tetralogy of Fallot * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer 'Transposition of the great vessels Explanation In transposition, the aorta comes off of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery comes off of the left ventricle. This causes 2 separate circulations-which is incompatible with life, unless there is effective mixing (or shunting) through an atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO). If there is no ASD or too small of an ASD/PFO, then an atrial communication can be enlarged by tearing a hole in the atrial septum by pulling a catheter with a balloon on the end of it through the foramen ovale. Atrial septostomy can also be useful for tricuspid or pulmonary atresia.

Which of the following is reinforced for a child through a game of playing peek-a-boo? Object permanence Stranger anxiety Acquisition of 10-25 words Ability to wave ""bye-bye"" Pincer grasp * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Object permanence Explanation For the game of peek-a-boo to be effective, the child must not anticipate the reappearance of the person who is temporarily out of sight. The understanding that the person still exists and will reappear requires the child to develop a sense of object permanence. Object permanence usually emerges between 9 and 12 months of age. The peek-a-boo play allows children to begin to grasp this concept. Note: We use the AAP and CDC evidence-informed milestones for developmental surveillance; other sources may differ. Stranger anxiety, which peaks around 9 months of age, is an emotional distress that a child experiences when confronted with an unfamiliar person. This plays no direct role in the game of peek-a-boo."

Serum bilirubin most often reaches maximum values near 10-12 mg/dL between 8-10 days of age in full-term infants. When compared to White infants or Black infants, Asian infants typically have lower peak levels of serum bilirubin at a younger age. Serum bilirubin most often reaches maximum values averaging 5-9 mg/dL between 72 and 96 hours of age in full-term infants. Bilirubin levels are higher in the newborn due to lower levels of serum albumin. Bilirubin clearance is decreased in newborns, which is mainly due to deficiency of the enzyme 58-reductase. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Serum bilirubin most often reaches maximum values averaging 5-9 mg/dL between 72 and 96 hours of age in full-term infants.

Answer & Explanation Answer Acchild born at 28 weeks with low birth weight Explanation Prematurity and low birth weight are the most common risk factors for the development of CP (359). Although some of this risk relates to complications of prematurity (e.g., increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage), low birth weight remains the highest risk factor for the development of CP, with 10% of babies < 1,500 g developing CP. An infant with low birth weight and prematurity is at the highest risk of cerebral palsy. In term infants, intrapartum asphyxia and infection are major causes of CP. Infection accounts for 15% of total spastic CP cases in normal weight children. A term infant with neonatal chlamydia is unlikely to develop CP. However, conjunctivitis and pneumonia are common symptoms of this infection. Hyperbilirubinemia is a rare cause of CP due to widespread use of phototherapy. >"

Which of the following drugs is associated with this defect following in utero exposure? Valproate Lamotrigine Levetiracetam Gabapentin Phenobarbital * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Valproate Explanation Although the majority of women with epilepsy have a normal pregnancy, fetal complications associated with the use of antiseizure medications (ASMs; a.k.a. antiepileptic drugs, anticonvulsants) during pregnancy are more common than in the general population. Up to 2% of fetuses exposed to valproate in utero develop neural tube defects (NTDs), a 4x increase when compared to babies born to mothers with epilepsy who used other antiseizure monotherapies, and a 10- to 20x increase when compared to the general population. NTDs often co-occur with cardiovascular, urogenital, skeletal, genital, and craniofacial malformations. The extent and severity of fetal anomalies is, at least in part, dose dependent.

Explanation The AAP 2017 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents recommends annual blood pressure (BP) screening in healthy children starting at 3 years of age. For children < 13 years of age, hypertension (HTN) is defined as BP > 95"" percentile for age, sex, and height. For teens > 13 years of age, normal BP is < 120/80 mm Hg and HTN is defined as = 130/80 mm Hg. If BP is found to be elevated, the readings must be confirmed in at least 2 additional separate visits. For this teen patient with BP > 130/80, a recheck of blood pressure in 2 weeks is a reasonable approach.

Which of the following is the likely cause of this patient's findings on cardiac auscultation? Alarge volume of blood rapidly filling a very compliant left ventricle Amoderate amount of pericardial fluid Blood entering a stiff, poorly compliant left ventricle during atrial contraction Prolapse of the mitral valve leaflets An opening snap (abrupt recoil) of a stenotic mitral valve * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Alarge volume of blood rapidly filling a very compliant left ventricle Explanation 'The patient has cardiac findings consistent with a prominent 3° heart sound (Ss). In this case, the S3 is actually produced ina hyperdynamic state with a very compliant left ventricle. During diastole, the ventricles normally fill in 2 steps-an early passive blood flow from the atria, followed by filling due to atrial contraction. During the passive phase of early diastole, an S3 may be heard. The $3 (a.k.a. the ventricular gallop) occurs just after Sp when the mitral valve opens, allowing passive filling of the left ventricle.

His review of systems is pertinent for intermittent fever and weight loss. A complete blood count is normal. A plain radiograph of the left femur reveals a proximal lytic lesion with an ""onion skin"" appearance. Which of the following statements is correct? A chromosomal translocation involving the EWSR1 gene is likely to be found. A biopsy will likely reveal osteoid-producing cells. It most commonly occurs in the metaphyses of long bones. Fever and weight loss are uncommon symptoms in this disease. In contrast to many other pediatric tumors, females are more commonly affected by this tumor. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view.

Hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome Hyper-immunoglobulin M syndrome X-linked agammaglobulinemia Bloom syndrome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome Explanation In hyper-immunoglobulin E (hyper-IgE) syndrome, neutrophils fail to adhere to the endothelium and enter the tissues (impaired chemotaxis). Secretion of chemokines and interleukins (e.g., IL-5, IL-11) bring eosinophils to the tissues, with secondary stimulation of IgE production and the severe atopic picture of eczema. However, the issues with neutrophil chemotaxis lead to deep abscesses, primarily with Staphylococcus aureus. Hyper-IgM syndrome is a group of rare immunodeficiency syndromes that result in an inability to make antibodies and cause a predisposition to recurrent and opportunistic infections. This is due to failure of immunoglobulin isotype switching, leading to normal/high IgM and low IgG and IgA. linked agammaglobulinemia (a.k.a.

Isolated myelomeningocele Duodenal atresia and endocardial cushion defect Clenched hands, cystic hygroma, and horseshoe kidney Severe midline facial abnormalities and polydactyly Fetal hydrops and coarctation * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Isolated myelomeningocele Explanation AFP is the maternal serum marker used in screening for neural tube defects (NTDs) affecting the spine and/or cranium. Screening is recommended at 16-20 weeks of gestation. Elevated levels of AFP require further evaluation for evidence of an NTD. By definition, open NTDs are characterized by exposed neural tissue and often involve both the spine and cranium. Neural tissue is not exposed in closed defects, which are usually localized to the spine. Spina bifida refers to a cleft in the spinal column. In spina bifida occulta, which is usually localized in the sacrolumbar region, the dorsal portions of the vertebrae fail to fuse with one another. The intact skin overlying the vertebral defect is often associated with a tuft of hair or dimpling. Open defects include a meningocele, characterized by herniation of the meninges through the cutaneous defect, and a myelomeningocele (a.k.a. meningomyelocele), characterized by herniation of both the meninges and spinal cord through the defect.

Pending suscepti! ity studies, which of the following would be the best antibiotic choice? Intravenous ampicillin Intravenous ceftazidime Intravenous gentamicin Oral vancomycin Intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Intravenous ampicillin Explanation ly Pending susceptibility results, amy lin alone provides sufficient therapy. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin can provide a synergistic effect that is often needed for more severe infections such as sepsis, meningitis, and endocarditis. An otherwise healthy child is likely not getting better because empiric antibiotic therapy is typically a cephalosporin, which has no activity against enterococci; the change to ampicillin monotherapy should be effective. Knowing that the species is E. faecalis is helpful-the organism is more likely to be susceptible to ampicillin or vancomycin (as opposed to E. faecium, which accounts for most of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci and rarely occurs in healthy children). >"

There is excessive plantar flexion of the foot and medial deviation of the forefoot, with the sole facing inward. The positioning is rigid and difficult to maneuver into a neutral position. The right foot appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this abnormality? Idiopathic Genetic abnormality Myelomeningocele Breech positioning Oligohydramnios * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Idiopathic Explanation & This patient most likely has pathic (congenital) clubfoot (aka talipes equinovarus), the most common form of clubfoot. Idiopathic clubfoot occurs in an otherwise healthy newborn. This abnormality affects the bones, muscles, tendons, and vasculature of one or both feet. The key anomaly is that the talus is small, which adversely affects its relationships with all of the surrounding structures. This leads to joint subluxation, underdevelopment of muscles and soft tissues, and shortening and fibrosis of muscles and tendons. On physical examination, the foot is turned medially, with the sole facing inward and the entire foot plantar flexed. The anatomic changes in the bones, muscles, and tendons make it rigid and difficult to maneuver to a neutral position. >"

A parasternal heave is noted during cardiac examination, both the 1°* and 2™4 heart sounds are split and an S, gallop is noted. There isa 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left, lower sternal border that radiates to the right lower sternal border. An echocardiogram reveals that the posterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve are displaced inferiorly into the right ventricle, and there is both severe tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial enlargement and right-to-left shunting at the atrial septum. Which of the following best describes expected findings on a radiograph of the chest in patients with this disorder? Anarrow mediastinum associated with mild cardiomegaly yielding an ""egg-on-a-string"" appearance Decreased vascular markings associated with a ""boot-shaped"" heart Anormal heart size with markedly decreased vascular markings Marked cardiomegaly, a ""wall-to-wall"" heart 'snowman' sign * Not Juestions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Marked cardiomegaly, a ""wall-to-wall"" heart Explanation Ebstein anomaly (EA) of the tricuspid valve is displacement of the tricuspid valve toward the apex of the right ventricle. This results in an effectively small right ventricle (RV) and ""atrialization"" of the RV segment superior to the displaced tricuspid valve. Symptoms vary based on severity. Newborns with EA and severe tricuspid regurgitation may be profoundly cyanotic. The severe tricuspid regurgitation associated with EA can yield massive right atrial enlargement and a ""wall-to-wall"" or ""box-shaped"" heart on"

'Transposition of the great vessels Ventricular septal defect Tricuspid atresia Tetralogy of Fallot Total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction of pulmonary venous return * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction of pulmonary venous return Explanation The correct agnosis is total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) with obstruction of the veins. 'TAPVRis a cyanotic congenital lesion in which all 4 pulmonary veins fail to make their normal connection to the left atrium. In unobstructive forms, pulmonary venous flow returns to the right atrium instead of the left atrium, which is followed by mixing with the systemic venous return in the right atrium. From the right atrium, this mixed venous blood (systemic plus pulmonary) enters the right ventricle and, via a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect, is shunted to the left side of the heart (left atria and then to left ventricle).

Her father, who suffers from chronic severe pain, had given her his methadone several hours earlier ""to help her sleep"" Upon finding the girl sedated at home, her father administered oral naloxone with minimal effect. Whyis oral naloxone much less effective than intravenous naloxone in this patient? First-pass effect Druginteractions Saturable pharmacokinetics Tolerance moa > Pharmacodynamic variability * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer A. First-pass effect Explanation Oral naloxone undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver, decreasing the amount that reaches the brain. IV naloxone bypasses: the liver, decreasing first-pass metabolism and increasing the effect. Drug interactions refer to the interaction of 2 or more drugs. The patient in this case likely has toxicity from simultaneous use of long- and short-acting opioids; however, this does not address the use of naloxone."

Short bowel syndrome without evidence of dumping Hemodynamic instability Upper gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating blood transfusion Bowel ileus resulting in emesis Necrotizing enterocolitis * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Short bowel syndrome without evidence of dumping Explanation Enteral tube feeding is indicated for infants whose immaturity and/or medical condition(s) preclude oral feedings. Many infants, and children with short bowel syndrome require enteral feedings. Short bowel syndrome is a malabsorptive state that often follows resection of a significant portion of the small intestines leading to deficiencies of both macronutrients and micronutrients. Providing enteral feeds by tube allows the feeds to be given over a longer period of time than bolus feeds, improving absorption. In neonates the most common causes of short bowel syndrome include necrotizing enterocolitis, meconium ileus, abdominal wall defects (e.g., gastroschisis, omphalocele), intestinal atresia, and volvulus. Enteral feeds, which enhance the process of intestinal adaptation, should be introduced early and advanced as rapidly as tolerated. Maximizing enteral feeds also helps to minimize the risks associated with parenteral nutrition (e., intestinal failure-associated liver disease. catheter-associated bacteremia).

Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated except for maternal smoking throughout. She denies any other substance use, and there is no family history of significant illnesses. This mother's substance use increases her baby's risk for which of the following after birth? Sudden infant death syndrome Hypotonicity Type 1 diabetes Restrictive lung disease Infertility * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Sudden infant death syndrome iN Explanation Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a well-established risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), one of the leading causes of postneonatal mortality. Studies show that maternal smoking more than doubles the risk of SIDS. This risk is modifiable to some extent; women who reduce their smoking or quit during pregnancy can decrease their risk of SIDS by 129-21%, respectively. Other adverse effects of maternal smoking on the fetus and neonate include intrauterine growth restriction (aka fetal growth restriction), premature birth, and increased signs of stress, hypertonicity, and excitability in newborns.

They deny known trauma, associated systemic symptoms, or a history of fractures. A radiograph of the right leg reveals anterior tibial bowing and a fracture in the middle third of the tibia, Which of the following conditions is known to be associated with the likely cause of these radiographic findings? Marfan syndrome Infantile hyperostosis Osteogenesis imperfecta Type 3 Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Mucopolysaccharidosis Type 2 (a.k.a. Hunter syndrome) * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Explanation The radiographic manifestations described are consistent with congenital pseudoarthrosis (false joint), most often characterized by unilateral anterolateral angulation (bowing) of the tibia progressing to thinning of the cortex and pathologic fracture. Long- bone pseudoarthrosis is a characteristic skeletal lesion occurring in 5-10% of infants and toddlers with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). Up to 80% of children with pseudoarthrosis have NF1; thus, any patient with pseudoarthrosis requires evaluation for NF1.

Answer & Explanation Answer 18 and 24 months Explanation The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP; 2020) recommends autism-specific screening in all children at both 18 and 24 months of age. These age groups represent a critical time frame for both language and social skills. 'The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT-R/F) is a scale that can be quickly completed by parents in an office setting. The scoring criteria were developed to identify children at increased risk of autism spectrum disorders (ie., not just, autism). The M-CHAT-R/F is designed to maximize sensitivity and therefore identifies some children who, on further evaluation, do not meet diagnostic criteria for a spectrum disorder. The MCHAT-R/F has a sensitivity 0.91 and specificity of 0.95 for low-risk 18- and 24-month-olds with follow-up questionnaire and interview.

He routinely takes low-dose aspirin due to a history of a coronary artery aneurysm, which was identified following a recent hospitalization for Kawasaki disease. Which of the following laboratory manifestations is most likely to be identified in this patient at the time of presentation? Respiratory alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis 'Transaminitis Anearly respiratory acidosis Hyponatremia * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Respiratory alkalosis Explanation In the early stages of salicylate poisoning, the most common laboratory finding is respiratory alkalosis. Salicylates stimulate the respiratory center in the brain, leading to an increase in respiratory rate and depth. This hyperventilation causes the body to exhale more carbon dioxide than it produces, resulting in a decrease in blood carbon dioxide levels and a consequent rise in blood PH (alkalosis). At the time of initial presentation, especially in acute cases, this respiratory alkalosis is the predominant feature. Respiratory alkalosis leads to increased loss of bicarbonate (HCO3) in the urine, and potassium as well. Treatment with HCOz magnifies this effect and leads to hypokalemia via shifting of potassium intracellularly. As time progresses, K~ is depleted and the"

The use of high doses of alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, will not place male patients at risk of infertility in the future. Children treated with intrathecal methotrexate are at an increased risk of brain tumors in the future. Children treated with cranial radiotherapy at less than 2 years of age can have major cognitive impairments. Patients treated with radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma are at an increased risk of bone cancer. Patients treated with vincristine for acute lymphoblastic leukemia have an approximately 33% chance of having some hearing deficit. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view.

His TSH was 15 mIU/L 3 months prior, and his dose of levothyroxine was increased from 50 meg/day to 75 mcg/day. His parents report administering the dose regularly every morning after breakfast. His TSH is now 20 mIU/L (normal range is 0.5~4.5 mlU/L). Which of the following is the best advice to give to the parents? 'Take the medication an hour before breakfast. Take the medication with milk. 'Take the medication after dinner. 'Take the medication with 2 glasses of water. Increase the administration to twice daily. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Take the medication an hour before breakfast. Explanation Some drugs require an acidic environment for absorption-especially the azole antifungals (except fluconazole and voriconazole), iron, and thyroid hormone-hence levothyroxine should be taken on an empty stomach. Any food, and particularly those containing calcium, iron, or other cations, can interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine; it should not be taken with milk or any meal. Taking this medication with extra water will not increase the absorption. Levothyroxine isa once-daily medication. If a dose increase is indicated, it should be given once daily."

Answer & Explanation Answer IV ampicillin and IV cefotaxime Explanation IV ampicillin and IV cefotaxime is the appropriate treatment for this pent Ampicillin is used to treat group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae) infections. It is also effective against Enterococcus and Listeria, which are rare causes of neonatal sepsis but are not covered with cephalosporins. Cefotaxime is effective against gram-negative bacteria (e.g., E. coli), another major cause of neonatal sepsis. In recent years, the declining prevalence of Listeria in the U.S. has led some experts to question the need for 3. Gentamicin can be used in place of cefotaxime once meningi ampicillin as part of the empiric regimen used for neonatal sepsi has been ruled out (gentamicin has poor CNS penetration) as it can have syngergistic effect for enteracoccal infections (which, again, is a rare cause of neonatal sepsis). For this patient of the selections listed, empiric therapy with ampicillin and cefotaxime is the best answer. >"

Answer & Explanation Answer Elevated leukocyte count in the peripheral blood Explanation Delayed separation of the umbilical cord, chronic gingivitis, and failure-to-thrive are common findings in leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). Patients with this disorder typically have marked elevation of the leukocyte count in the peripheral blood (30,000-100,000/uL during infections) because of an underlying defect in leukocyte migration and adherence. Recurrent bacterial (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli) and fungal (eg, Aspergillus, Candida) infections of the skin, mucous membranes, and respiratory and lower gastrointestinal tracts are often fatal within the first 10 years of life without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The absence of swelling, erythema, warmth, and pus at the site of infection(s) is characteristic.

mxrest_owVlfOr0gu,"Question Details A5-year-old patient with a known metabolic disorder is started on 500 mg/day of pyridoxine. To assess response to treatment, this patient should subsequently have which of the following measured in the serum? A. Homocysteine B Leucine © Glycine D_ Isoleucine © Tyrosine * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. b Answer A Homocysteine Explanation Inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, homocystinuria is caused by a defect in the gene coding for cystathionine B-synthase, which converts homocysteine into cystathionine during metabolism of dietary protein. The gene defect leads to the accumulation of homocysteine, some of which is reconverted into methionine. Elevated levels of homocysteine increase the risk of vascular disease and thrombus formation, likely due to a combination of endothelial cell damage, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, upregulation of prothrombotic factors, and downregulation of antithrombotic factors. Some patients will respond to pyridoxine (200-1,000 mg/day), which enhances activity of the deficient enzyme. The addition of folic acid and vitamin B42 is recommended in patients who initially do not improve because folate depletion may cause the patient to be unresponsive to pyridoxine.

'These parents have a < 5% chance of having a 3"" child affected with sickle cell disease. These parents are more likely to have another boy with sickle cell disease than a girl with sickle cell disease. When both parents have sickle cell trait, most of their offspring will have neither trait nor disease. 'These parents have a 3 in 4 chance of having another child with sickle cell trait. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer These parents have a 1 in 4 chance of having another child with sickle cell disease.

Adenine is replaced by thymidine, which results in valine being encoded instead of glutamic acid. Sickle cell anemia (HbSS) is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Therefore, parents who are both heterozygote carriers (sickle cell trait; HbAS) of the gene mutation have a 25% (1 in 4) chance of having an offspring with SCD. The risk of SCD increases to 50% if one of the parents is homozygous for the gene mutation and the other parent is a carrier."

mxrest_QG8THzN4pL,"Question Details When reviewing an electrocardiogram, which of the following represents the time it takes for the cardiac impulse to travel from the sinus node through the atrioventricular (AV) node and His bundle, to the onset of ventricular depolarization? The P wave duration The start of the P wave to the end of the T wave The PR interval The QT interval The QRS duration * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer The PR interval Explanation The ECG tracing represents atrial systole, ventricular systole, and ventricular repolarization. The P wave correlates with atrial depolarization. The PR interval is measured from the start of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex, thus includes the time from atrial depolarization to conduction through the AV node and His bundle to the onset of ventricular systole. 'The PR interval varies with age and heart rate. It prolongs with vagal input and shortens at faster heart rates and increased sympathetic tone. A short PR interval is seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome secondary to ventricular preexcitation. In WPW, some conduction from the atria bypasses the AV node via an accessory pathway to preexcite the ventricle. WPW is associated with supraventricular tachycardia. PR prolongation is seen in patients with rheumatic fever or Lyme disease. >"

The child also complains of abdominal pain and joint pain, particularly in his knees and ankles. The child has no history of trauma or injury; however, the child had an upper respiratory infection (URI) 2- 3weeks prior. Which lab is most likely to be abnormal? Platelet count Prothrombin time Partial thromboplastin time Urinalysis, Serum sodium * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Urinalysis Explanation The correct answer is urinalysis. A palpable purpuric rash on the buttocks and lower extremities, joint pain, and abdominal pain in a child between 2 and 7 years of age are suspicious for IgA vasculitis (IgAV; formerly Henoch-Schonlein purpura [HSP]). There is often a history of a preceding pharyngitis or URI. IgAV is a systemic vasculitis that can cause glomerulonephritis due to IgA deposition in the kidneys. Nephritis can cause hematuria and proteinuria-either gross or microscopic.

Which of the following is most likely to be associated with this finding? Aseptal defect associated with a bicuspid aortic valve An indwelling catheter Aperipherally inserted central catheter line Reduced pH of dental plaque A leukocyte adhesion disorder * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Reduced pH of dental plaque Explanation Dental caries are caused by a group of microorganisms, S. mutans, that adhere to dental enamel. Bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates, especially sucrose, produces organic acids that decrease the pH of dental plaque, leading to demineralization and the development of dental caries. As the enamel cavitates, other oral bacteria contribute to further demineralization through production of additional organic acids. Prolonged exposure to cariogenic sugars during sleep is especially harmful, as are candies that stick to the teeth. All children, regardless of risk for caries, should be referred to a dentist at or near 1 year of age.

He wears a continuous glucose monitor and most of his blood glucose levels are between 80 and 180 mg/dL. His hemoglobin A1cis 6.1%. His mother asks you about the ""honeymoon period"" in new-onset Type 1 diabetes mellitus. What is the etiology of this phenomenon? Residual islet cell function Increased insulin sensitivity Decreased ketone production Excessive cortisol production Decreased carbohydrate intake * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Residual islet cell function Explanation Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus often present at a time when they have very little islet cell function. Longstanding hyperglycemia is toxic to islet cells (termed ""glucotoxicity""), and this results in a decline in their function (a ""shock"" that prevents insulin secretion in the still-functioning cells). Often this causes acute onset of diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis when insulin secretion is completely suppressed. After starting insulin therapy and improvement of hyperglycemia, the glucotoxicity is eliminated and the remaining islet cells are able to produce insulin again for some period of time. This is often referred to as the honeymoon period following the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. This can last for months to years and is not seer all"

Chest trauma can lead to a number of injuries, with the most common in children being pulmonary contusion, pneumo- or hemothorax, and rib fracture. In this case, the lack of lung sounds, crackling sensation of subcutaneous air, and hypotension point toward a tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift causing impaired venous return to the heart and hypoter yn, thus requiring emergent needle decompression or needle thoracostomy.

What is the appropriate emergent management? Immediately raise the serum sodium concentration by 2-3 mEq/L with 3% saline. Immediately raise the serum sodium concentration to the normal range using 3% saline. Immediately raise the serum sodium concentration halfway to the normal range using 3% saline. Raise the serum sodium concentration by 0.5 mEq/L/hour until normal by using 0.9% normal saline. Raise the serum sodium concentration by 2-3 mEq/L/hour until normal by using 0.9% normal saline. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation se the serum sodium concentration by 2-3 mEq/L with 3% saline. Explanation For patients with severe symptoms such as seizure or coma, 3% saline should be administered immediately to raise the serum sodium concentration by 2-3 mEq/L. Raising the serum sodium to the normal range or halfway to the normal range would place the patient at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Although the general rule in treating hyponatremia is to raise the serum sodium concentration by < 0.5 mEq/L/hour (or < 10 mEq/L/24 hours), this answer is incorrect, as immediate action is needed to raise the serum sodium into a range where CNS symptoms abate. >"

Which of the following occurs with increased frequency in patients with this disorder? Atlantoaxial subluxation Scoliosis Spondylolisthesis Avascular necrosis of the femoral head Clubfoot * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Atlantoaxial subluxation Explanation Individuals with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are at incredsea risk of atlantoaxial instability. 'The atlas is the 1* cervical vertebra and is responsible for supporting the skull. It is composed of a ring of bone made up of 2 lateral masses joined at the front and back by the anterior and the posterior arches. The 2™4 cervical vertebra, the axis, has a blunt, tooth- like process that projects upward. Also referred to as the ""dens"" or odontoid process, it provides a type of pivot and collar, which allows the head and atlas to rotate around the dens. The incidence of atlantoaxial instability among individuals with trisomy 21 has been reported to be as high as 20%. Spinal cord injury may result when atlantoaxial instability results in subluxation or dislocation of the 1 and 24 cervical vertebrae.

This patient is at increased risk of adverse effects associated with the following treatments: Insulin Intravenous immunoglobulin Antiepileptics Topical steroids Antibiotics * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Intravenous immunoglobulin Explanation hs Therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies such as CVID and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA; aka Bruton agammaglobulinemia), as these patients do not make antibodies. It may also be used in other disorders such as Kawasaki disease. Patients with selective IgA deficiency, defined by a serum IgA concentration of < 7 mg/dL in patients > 4 years of age, have normal serum levels of IgG and IgM. These patients may have preformed antibodies against IgA. As a result (although rare), anaphylaxis may follow the administration of IVIG, presenting with diffuse flushing, urticaria, hypotension, tachycardia, chest pain (sometimes radiating to the back) or tightness, shortness of breath, nausea, and/or vomiting.

Without parental support, a weight loss program has a high success rate as longas the child is determined. Grazing throughout the day is more effective for weight loss than consuming set meals and snacks. Stressing the importance of good dietary habits and exercise to the parent is usually enough to elicit change. Media-free times should be enforced. Bariatric surgery should be considered in the next year if diet and exercise do not offer improvement. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Media-free times should be enforced. Explanation Excessive media use can be linked to obesity (i.e, BMI = gsth percentile), aggression, behavioral problems, poor school performance, anxiety, depression, and poor sleep. For children > 6 years of age, important to place consistent limits on the types of media and the time spent using media. Make sure the media does not take the place of adequate sleep (8-12 hours per day, depending on age), physical activity (1 hour per day), and other behaviors essential to health. In addition, use of screen media (other than video chatting) should be avoided in children under 2 years of age. For children 2-5 years of age, screen use should be limited to 1 hour per day of high-quality programming. Family support and involvement are critical for weight loss interventions to succeed.

On physical exam you identify pallor. You order a CBC and CRP. Her CRPis normal. Which of the following statements about the result is most likely? Hemoglobin is 12.5 g/dL. Ferritin is 144 ng/mL. Mean corpuscular volume is 68 fL. Mean corpuscular volumeis 108 fL. Red blood cell distribution width is 13%. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Mean corpuscular volume is 68 fL. Explanation This young child is expected to have iron deficiency anemia (IDA) because of her history of excessive milk intake. Anemia secondary to iron deficiency manifests as a microcytic (low mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) hypochromic anemia. MCV of 68 fL is below the normal range for a 2-year-old child, making this the correct answer. Her labs should show anemia (decreased hemoglobin), but hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL is within the normal range for her age (~ 10.5- 13.5 g/dL). Her anemia is caused by decreased iron stores secondary to inadequate intake, which will make her ferritin low. A ferritin of 144 >"

Acute chest syndrome Transient ischemic attack Hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL In preparation for surgery Acute splenic sequestration * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL. Explanation Because unnecessary simple transfusions have serious consequences of iron overload, risk of infection, and induction of autoantibodies, thought should always be given as to whether a patient with sickle cell anemia (SCA) truly needs a simple transfusion. Anemia alone (Hgb < 7 g/dL) is not an indication for simple transfusion in patients with SCA unless they are symptomatic, which is rare because these patients are generally very well compensated. In acute chest syndrome, the most important treatment is immediate transfusion to bring up the percentage of normal hemogiol and reduce red blood cell (RBC) sickling.

Which of the following findings is most likely to be observed during the physical examination of this patient? Lifts head to 90° when lying prone Lifts head off the surface of the examination table in anticipation of being lifted Transfers an object from hand to hand Pushes up onto elbows/forearms when in the prone position Sits with support by leaning on hands * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Lifts head to 90° when lying prone Explanation By 4 months of age, the head lag should disappear and the infant should be able to lift his head 90° while prone. At this age, some infants begin to roll from front to back as well. By 6 months of age, > 75% of infants roll from front (tummy) to back. Since the recommendation was instituted for back sleeping, to decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, rolling often occurs later than previously seen. Frequent tummy time can support the development of this milestone. Note: We use the AAP and CDC evidence-informed milestones for developmental surveillance; other sources may differ. Aninfant can lift his head off of the examination table in anticipation of being lifted by 6 months of age. >"

Which of the following disorders is this patient most likely to have? Omphalocele Meckel diverticulum Duodenal atresia Gastroschisis Jejunal atresia * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Gastroschisis Explanation & Gastroschisis is believed to be caused by a vascular accident involving the right umbilical vein or the right omphalomesenteric artery. Normally, the right umbilical vein involutes at approximately 30 days after conception. Premature involution or disruption of the right omphalomesenteric artery leads to necrosis of the lateral abdominal wall to the right of the umbilicus, thus allowing for herniation of abdominal contents into the amniotic cavity and outside of the body. In contrast to an omphalocele, gastrosct not covered by a peritoneal sac and is far less likely (5- 10% vs. up to 75%) to be associated with additional congenital anomalies. Some studies suggest that gastroschisis is associated with younger maternal age and the use of vasoactive drugs (e-g., pseudoephedrine, cocaine, nicotine). >"

More than 90% of natal teeth represent premature eruption of the primary deciduous teeth of infants. Natal tooth eruption is a common findingin newborn infants. Natal teeth are always supernumerary. Natal teeth should always be extracted within the first 3 months of life. Natal teeth are always associated with genetic syndromes. * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer More than 90% of natal teeth represent premature eruption of the primary deciduous teeth of infants. Explanation Most natal teeth (90%) are prematurely erupting deciduous teeth. Natal teeth are an uncommon anomaly in pediatrics. Early extraction may leave an infant/child with a gap, which may impair further mouth development. Hence, they should not be removed until it is confirmed by x-ray that they are supernumerary, indicating there is defective or no root development to the natal tooth. Supernumerary teeth can be removed because they may cause problems with feeding or may pose an aspiration risk."

A 1 morning voided urine reveals an albumin:creatinine ratio of 220 mg/g, confirmed on 3 occasions. Which of the following is true about medications commonly used to reduce albuminuria in patients with this condition? Albumin excretion is reduced by alteration of glomerular blood flow by dilation of the efferent arterioles. Medications are not indicated until albuminuria reaches the threshold of 300 mg albumin per g creatinine (severely increased albuminuria). Mechanism of action is vasodilation by blocking smooth muscle calcium channel receptors. Sexual activity is not of concern with use of these medications.

Brain abscess Left heart failure Left-to-right shunt Atrial septal defect Left ventricular hypertrophy * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Brain abscess Explanation Brain abscesses are a recognized, albeit uncommon, complication of unrepaired TOF in patients who have a significant right to left shunt, along with cerebral thrombosis with hemiplegia and infective endocarditis. Patients with TOF have pulmonary outflow obstruction causing a right-to-left shunt across a VSD bypassing the filtering action of the lungs. This can allow infected material, like bacteria or fungi, to reach the brain directly, potentially leading to the formation of brain abscesses. Patients with TOF are likely to get cyanosis, hypoxemia, and resulting poor growth. They have right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) from pulmonary outflow obstruction; they do not typically have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or left heart failure (HF). ""Tet"" (a.k.a. hypercyanotic) spells result from an acute increase in right-to-left shunting.

The FDA Orange Book definition of bioequivalence requires the products to be pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives when studied under similar conditions. Pharmaceutical equivalents have identical amounts of the same active drug ingredient in the same dosage form and route of administration, and meet applicable standards of strength, quality, purity, and identity. Inactive ingredients are often substances added to improve taste, help the tablet stick together or dissolve, or act as a preservative. These ingredients have little to no impact biologically when consumed, so do not play a role in pharmaceutical equivalence. Pharmaceutical alternatives have the same therapeutic moiety, though not necessarily the same inactive ingredients, strength, or dosage form (e.g., they may contain different salts or esters).

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's recurrent infections? Neisseria meningitidis Herpes simplex virus Clostridium perfringens Pseudomonas aeruginosa Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhi * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Neisseria meningitidis bs Explanation The complement system plays a crucial role in the immune response against infection, with the CH50 level being a measure of the overall activity of the classical complement pathway. A markedly decreased CH50 level, as noted in the patient's lab findings, suggests a significant deficiency in the complement system. This can be particularly indicative of deficiencies in the terminal cascade proteins, specifically CS-C9. These proteins are vital for forming the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is essential for lysing and killing certain pathogens, notably Neisseria meningitidis (a.k.a. meningococcus). Therefore, a deficiency in these"

C. difficile colitis has been reported to follow treatment with penicillins, macrolides, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Recent guidelines suggest PCR-based toxin assays are the most sensitive for C. difficile toxins. The recommended first-line treatment is with oral vancomycin or, if the case is mild or moderate, oral metronidazole. Up to 25% of patients may require a 2™ course of treatment due to recurrence of symptoms."

mxrest_ZS4LmckotH,"Question Details Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the treatment of choice for which of the following conditions? Selective IgA deficiency C5-C9 deficiency Chronic granulomatous disease X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia Severe congenital neutropenia (a.k.a. Kost mann syndrome) * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia Explanation linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA; a.k.a. Bruton agammaglobulinemia) is caused by a mutation in the gene BTK (at Xq22) that encodes for Bruton tyrosine kinase, which is nec¥Ssary for B-cell development. This results in agammaglobulinemia and susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections with encapsulated organisms. Therefore, IVIG is beneficial for patients with XLA. IVIG is not usually indicated in selective IgA deficiency, because IgG levels and antibodies are usually normal in these patients. However, some patients with selective IgA deficiency can progress to CVID over time. IVIG can contain small amounts of IgA. Some patients with IgA deficiency have anti-IgA IgE antibodies and may develop anaphylaxis after receiving IVIG. If IVIG is needed, these patients should receive a product with low IgA content. C5-C9 deficiency (a.k.a. terminal complement deficiency) results in impaired immune function against Neisseria and other gram- hy"

Calcium oxalate crystals 4+ proteinuria Oval fat bodies and lipid laden casts Uricacid crystals Cystine crystals * Note: Questions cannot be answered from this view. Answer & Explanation Answer Calcium oxalate crystals Explanation Antifreeze contains ethylene glycol-a toxic, colorless, and odorless fluid with a sweet taste, which some children find appealing. Within 30 minutes of ingestion, patients may appear intoxicated with associated nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, and confusion. Rapid (12-36 hours) accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol leads to tachycardia and increased respiratory rate. Metabolites of ethylene glycol include glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid. Oxalic acid combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals, which deposit in the renal tubules leading to acute tubular injury (a.k.a. acute tubular necrosis). Hypocalcemia ensues, leading to dysrhythmias and severe muscle spasm. Ingestion of ethylene glycol also leads to >"

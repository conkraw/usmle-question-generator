Rules:
1. Output exactly one line containing exactly 12 comma-separated values corresponding to the fields above, with no header and no extra text.
2. Do not include any commas in any field value; if needed, use semicolons instead.
3. The 'record_id' can be any random string (the script will override it if necessary).
4. The 'question' should be a full clinical vignette describing a realistic pediatric scenario.
5. The 'anchor' is a concise clinical question (e.g., "What is the most likely diagnosis?").
6. Provide exactly five answer choices (answerchoice_a to answerchoice_e) that are distinct and brief.
7. The 'correct_answer' must be one of: a, b, c, d, or e (lowercase).
8. The 'answer_explanation' should briefly explain why the correct answer is right and why the others are not.
9. The 'age' should be a decimal number representing the patient's age in years (for example, 0.5 for 6 months).
10. The 'subject' must be the number {subject_number} as defined by the subject map below.

Rules:
1. Output exactly one line with exactly 12 fields separated by commas, with no header and no additional text.
2. Do not include any quotation marks (") or any extra punctuation other than commas; if a comma is needed within a field, replace it with a semicolon.
3. The 'record_id' should be a random string with no quotes.
4. The 'question' should be a realistic pediatric clinical vignette.
5. The 'anchor' is a concise clinical question (e.g., What is the most likely diagnosis?).
6. Provide exactly five answer choices (answerchoice_a to answerchoice_e) that are distinct and brief.
7. The 'correct_answer' must be one of: a, b, c, d, or e in lowercase.
8. The 'answer_explanation' should briefly explain why the correct answer is right and why the others are not.
9. The 'age' should be a decimal number representing the patient's age in years (for example, 0.5 for 6 months).
10. The 'subject' must be exactly the number {subject_number} (without quotes).

For example (this is only for reference and should not be output):
NKX5W27B,A 4-year-old boy presents with a white reflex on exam,What is the most likely diagnosis?,Cataract,Retinoblastoma,Strabismus,Glaucoma,Persistent fetal vasculature,b,Retinoblastoma should be suspected in any child with leukocoria; other options are less consistent,4,18

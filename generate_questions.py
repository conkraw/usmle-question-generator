    - The 'anchor' is the main clinical question being asked â€” e.g., "What is the most likely diagnosis?" or "What is the next best step in management?"
    - The five answer choices should be distinct and appropriate.
    - 'correct_answer' should be one of: a, b, c, d, or e.
    - 'answer_explanation' should include why the correct answer is correct and why the others are not.
    - 'age' should be in years as a decimal (e.g., 0.5 for 6 months).
    - 'subject' must be the number {subject_number} from the map below.
